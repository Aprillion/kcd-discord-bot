// handle reactions to open clubs
// ‚úã - add to role (removing reaction removes role)
// - Once there are 12, then delete any new ractions
// üèÅ - prevent new people from joining (only captain/owner/moderators/admins can do this)
// - Edit message to say it's started already, encourage them to copy and start a new one themselves

// Make it easy to scan to know which clubs are full and which are still open for new members
